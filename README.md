# VRCausality
Experimental space for testing judgements about action/inaction causality and recency effect.


INSTALL:
There should be a link to an executable sometime soon. Until then, clone this repository and open the project in Unity for testing. This project is compatible with Unity 2019.2.7f2. Go to the project folder in the Unity explorer and open the InteractableObjects scene (in VRTK folder) and press play.

On Windows, the location of the CSV file containing the test results should be C: => Users => [user] => AppData => samrobertson => vrtest1.
